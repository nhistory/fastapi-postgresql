## Initialize python virtual environment

venv (for Python 3) and virtualenv (for Python 2) allow you to manage separate package installations for different projects. They essentially allow you to create a “virtual” isolated Python installation and install packages into that virtual installation.

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
deactivate
```

In order to install basic python virtual environment, you should enter command ```python3 -m venv <folder name>```.
```source env/bin/activate``` command will activate virtual environment. If you don't activate this environment any longer, you can use ```deactivate``` command. We can see the envirnment is activated by information on the side.
